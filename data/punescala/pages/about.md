## About

PuneScala is the community site of Scala practitioners from Pune. It is started by developers at [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/) who are passionate Scala users for many years. This is the forum where we will announce Scala community events, training programs, workshops, etc. We will be happy to have other local companies contribute. They can host events or offer to speak on Scala topics. This site is [hosted on github](https://github.com/punescala/punescala.github.io), send us your pull requests with Scala related updates.

Please ask questions or join discussions at [punescala google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/punescala). Join [PuneScala Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/punescala) to be notified about Scala related events. Follow our Twitter handle [@punescala](https://twitter.com/punescala) for all the local news on Scala.
