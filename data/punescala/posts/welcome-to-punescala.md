We are happy to launch a new community site dedicated for Scala events in Pune. If you would like to contribute by hosting a community event, blog post etc., let us know. We recently hosted [Pune Scala Symposium](http://info.thoughtworks.com/pune-scala-symposium-april-12-registration.html) where we announced about a free for all Scala training in June. Well, the dates are now finalized. Read the [training announcement here](/training/2014/05/15/principles-of-programming-in-scala/). To know more about us visit the [About page](/about).
